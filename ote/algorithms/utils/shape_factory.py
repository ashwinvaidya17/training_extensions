class ShapeFactory:
    """
    Helper class converting between shape types
    """

    @staticmethod
    def shape_as_rectangle(shape: ShapeEntity) -> Rectangle:
        """
        Get the outer-fitted rectangle representation of the shape.
        `media_width` and `media_height` are the width and height of the media in
        which the shape is expressed.

        :example: Let's assume a DatasetItem `dataset_item`.

        To obtain the shapes inside the full annotation as rectangles, one could call:

        >>> from ote_sdk.entities.dataset_item import DatasetItem
        >>> from ote_sdk.entities.image import NullImage
        >>> from ote_sdk.entities.annotation_scene import NullAnnotationScene
        >>> dataset_item = DatasetItem(media=NullImage(),
        >>>     annotation=NullAnnotationScene())
        >>> rectangles = [ShapeFactory.shape_as_rectangle(shape,
        >>>     dataset_item.media.width, dataset_item.media.height) for shape
        ... in dataset_item.annotation_scene.shapes]

        To obtain the shapes inside the dataset item (note that dataset item can have
        roi), one should call:

        >>> rectangles = [ShapeFactory.shape_as_rectangle(shape) for shape in
        >>>     dataset_item.get_annotations()]

        Since the shapes in the first call come from annotation directly, this means
        they are expressed in the media coordinate system. Therefore,
        dataset_item.media.width and dataset_item.media.height are passed.
        While in the second call, the shapes come from denormalization results wrt.
        dataset_item.roi and therefore expressed inside the roi. In this case,
        dataset_item.width and dataset_item.height are passed.

        :example: Converting Ellipse to rectangle

        >>> height = 240
        >>> width = 480
        >>> rectangle = Rectangle(x1=0.375, y1=0.25, x2=0.625, y2=0.75,
        ... labels=[]) # a square of 120 x 120 pixels at the center of the image
        >>> ellipse = Ellipse(x1=0.5, y1=0.5, x2=0.625, y2=0.56125,
        ... labels=[]) # an ellipse of radius 60 pixels (x2 is wrt width) at the
        center of the image
        >>> ellipse_as_rectangle = ShapeFactory.shape_as_rectangle(ellipse)  # get the
        fitted rectangle for the ellipse
        >>> str(rectangle) == str(ellipse_as_rectangle)
        True

        Converting triangle to rectangle

        >>> points = [Point(x=0.5, y=0.25), Point(x=0.375, y=0.75),
        >>>     Point(x=0.625, y=0.75)]
        >>> triangle = Polygon(points=points, labels=[])
        >>> triangle_as_rectangle = ShapeFactory.shape_as_rectangle(triangle)
        >>> str(triangle_as_rectangle) == str(rectangle)
        True
